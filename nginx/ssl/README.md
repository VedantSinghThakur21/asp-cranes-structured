# SSL Configuration for ASP Cranes

This directory contains SSL certificates for the nginx server.

## For Development:
- Self-signed certificates will be automatically generated by the Docker container
- These are suitable for local development and testing

## For Production:
- Place your production SSL certificates here:
  - `nginx.crt` - SSL certificate file
  - `nginx.key` - SSL private key file
  - `nginx.ca` - Certificate Authority bundle (optional)

## Generating Development Certificates:

```bash
# Generate self-signed certificate for development
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout nginx.key \
  -out nginx.crt \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=ASP-Cranes/CN=localhost"
```

## Security Notes:
- Never commit production certificates to version control
- Keep private keys secure and with appropriate file permissions
- Use strong SSL configurations in production
