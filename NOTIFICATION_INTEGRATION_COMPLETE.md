## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### ⚡ Quick Start (Use the deployment script)
```bash
# On Windows
.\deploy_notification_engine.bat

# On Linux/Mac
./deploy_notification_engine.sh
```

### 🔧 Manual Setup Steps
1. **Install packages**: `npm install nodemailer twilio ws`
2. **Run database schema**: Import `enhanced_notifications_schema.sql`
3. **Configure environment**: Set up SMTP and Twilio credentials
4. **Start server**: The notification engine will auto-initialize
5. **Test functionality**: Use provided API endpoints

### 📧 Email Configuration (Required)
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=ASP Cranes CRM <your-email@gmail.com>
```

### 📱 SMS Configuration (Optional)
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

## 🎛️ How It Works

### Automatic Event Detection
The system automatically detects business events and triggers appropriate notifications:

```javascript
// Example: When a new lead is created
const newLead = await createLead(leadData);
await notificationService.sendLeadCreatedNotification(newLead);
// → Automatically sends multi-channel notifications to assigned users
```

### Smart Channel Selection
The engine automatically chooses the best delivery channels based on:
- **User preferences** (email enabled/disabled, quiet hours, etc.)
- **Notification priority** (urgent notifications bypass quiet hours)
- **Business rules** (critical alerts always sent via multiple channels)

### Template System
Dynamic templates automatically populate with relevant data:
```
"New lead '{{lead.company}}' assigned to you. 
Contact: {{lead.contact_name}} ({{lead.phone}})
Priority: {{lead.priority}}"
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Real-time Monitoring
- Server logs show notification delivery status
- WebSocket connections display in real-time
- Failed deliveries are automatically retried

### Analytics Dashboard (API Endpoints)
- `GET /api/notifications/analytics` - Delivery statistics
- `GET /api/notifications/logs` - Detailed delivery logs
- `GET /api/notifications/user` - User-specific notification history

## 🔧 Customization Options

### 1. Add New Notification Types
```javascript
// Add to notification templates
await notificationEngine.createTemplate({
  name: 'equipment_maintenance_due',
  subject: 'Equipment Maintenance Required',
  content: 'Equipment {{equipment.name}} requires maintenance...'
});
```

### 2. Create Custom Rules
```javascript
// Add routing rules
await notificationEngine.createRule({
  event_type: 'equipment_maintenance',
  priority: 'high',
  channels: ['email', 'sms', 'in_app']
});
```

### 3. User Preference Management
Users can customize their notification preferences through the API:
- Enable/disable channels
- Set quiet hours
- Choose notification types

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues
1. **Email not sending**: Verify Gmail App Password setup
2. **WebSocket not connecting**: Check port 3001 accessibility  
3. **Database errors**: Ensure schema was applied correctly
4. **SMS not sending**: Verify Twilio credentials and account credits

### Debug Mode
Set `NODE_ENV=development` for detailed logging
